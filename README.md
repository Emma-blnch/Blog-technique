# ✨ Technical blog - Compile this for me!

Welcome to my personal blog dedicated to my learning of computer development, in particular C language and web basics 💻

## 🎯 Why this blog?

After several years in the audiovisual industry 🎥, I chose to reorient myself towards software development.  

Today, I'm a student at Ecole 42 in Paris, where I'm learning to code in C, manipulate memory, manage team projects... and I wanted a place to **share what I'm learning**, put down my ideas, and maybe help other people who are just starting out too!

This blog is both :
- my **personal memo**
- a **space for popularization**
- a **support** for others who are **reconverting** or **learning**.

## 📚 What you'll find in this blog

I regularly feed the blog with articles on the basics of the C language and dev :

- 🔢 The **basic types in C** (`int`, `char`, `float`, `const`, etc.)
- 📦 The **standard libraries**.
- 🧠 **Memory management** (stack vs heap)
- 🚨 **Common error messages** and how to understand them
- 🔗 The **pointers**
- and many more to come!

All content is written (in French) in a simple, pictorial way to really understand as much as possible.
> As I'm still learning, mistakes can potentially creep into my articles, so don't hesitate to let me know!
